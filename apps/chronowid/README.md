# Chronometer Widget

Chronometer (timer) that runs as a widget.
The advantage is, that you can still see your normal watchface and other widgets when the timer is running.
The widget is always active, but only shown when the timer is on.
Hours, minutes, seconds and timer status can be set with an app.
